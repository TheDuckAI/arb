### Abstract

ARB is a novel benchmark dataset composed of advanced reasoning problems designed to evaluate LLMs on text comprehension and expert domain reasoning, presenting a more challenging test than prior benchmarks, featuring questions that test deeper knowledge of mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, and law.

This repository hosts a problem sampler as well as the dedicated API for our dataset.
